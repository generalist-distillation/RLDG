# RLDG: Robotic Generalist Policy Distillation via Reinforcement Learning

This file contains the instructions for reproducing RLDG as presented in the [paper](https://generalist-distillation.github.io/). 

## 1. Task setup
We focus this guide on reproducing the Connector Insertion experiment with a Franka arm.

1. Download and 3D print the [wrist camera mount](./static/files/wrist_mount.step) and the [D-type connector housing](./static/files/D-type_holder.step).
2. We provide the [purchase links](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqI_bZoseVatrwyDrtJxsr7Ay13MIeRVuGdN5knIEHc/edit?usp=sharing) to the connectors we used in our experiment. You may choose to purchase what you need.

For instructions setting up the FMB Insertion and FMB Assembly tasks, please refer to the [FMB project page](https://functional-manipulation-benchmark.github.io).
